# SealPIR: A computational PIR library that achieves low communication costs and high performance.

SealPIR is a research library and should not be used in production systems. 
SealPIR allows a client to download an element from a database stored by a server without
revealing to the server which element was downloaded. SealPIR was introduced at 
the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) in 2018. You can find
a copy of the paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1142.pdf).

# Compiling SEAL

SealPIR depends on [Microsoft SEAL version 4.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/tree/4.0.0).

Download and install SEAL (follow the instructions in the above link) before before compiling SealPIR.

# Compiling SealPIR

Once Microsoft SEAL 4.0.0 is installed, to build SealPIR simply run:

```
cmake .
make
```

This should produce a binary file ``bin/main``.

# Testing SealPIR

Once you have compiled SealPIR, you can run our battery of unit tests with:

```
ctest .
```

# Using SealPIR

Take a look at the example in `src/main.cpp` for how to use SealPIR. 
You can also look at the tests in the `test` folder.


## Default parameters

*N* indicates the degree of the BFV polynomials.  Default is 4096.

*t* indicates the plaintext modulus, but we specify *log t* instead. Default is 20.

Each BFV ciphertext can encrypt log t * N, which is approximately 10 KB bits of information.

This means that if your database has, say, 1 KB elements, then you can pack 10 
such elements into a single BFV plaintext. 
On the other hand, if your database has, say, 20 KB elements, then you will 
need two BFV plaintexts to represent each of your elements.

*d* represents the recursion level.  When the number of BFV plaintexts needed
to represent your database (see above for how to map the number of database
elements of a given size to the number of BFV plaintexts) is smaller than N,
then setting *d = 1* minimizes communication costs. However, you can also set
*d = 2* which doubles the size of the query and increases the size of the
response by roughly a factor of 4, but in some cases might reduce computational
costs a little bit (because the oblivious expansion procedure is cheaper). 

When the number of BFV plaintexts is much greater than N, then *d = 2*
minimizes communication costs. You can read the paper to understand how *d*
affects communication costs. In general, the query consists of *d* BFV
ciphertexts and can index a database with *N^d* BFV plaintexts;  the response
consists of *F^(d-1)* ciphertexts, where *F* is the ciphertext
expansion factor. In the current implementation which uses recursive
modulo swithcing, *F* is around 4. We have not identified any setting where
*d > 2* is beneficial.


# Changelog

This implementation of SealPIR uses the latest version of SEAL, fixes several bugs,
and provides better serialization/deserialization of queries and responses,
and a more streamlined code base.

If you wish to use the **original** version of SealPIR which corresponds to the
numbers reported in the paper and which uses an older version  of SEAL, check
out [this](https://github.com/microsoft/SealPIR/tree/ccf86c50fd3291) branch in
the git repository.
